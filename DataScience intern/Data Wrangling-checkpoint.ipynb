    "**Data wrangling**, in simpler terms, it is the process of transforming raw data into another format to make it more suitable for analytics. It may involve structuring and cleaning the data to make it more usable. For eg: Filtering the data by a particular year, replacing null values with mean and merging two or more columns. These were just a few examples of data wrangling. As a data scientist, you would have to probably spend most of the time in data wrangling.<br>\n",

    "1. Improve the Quality – Many a time; the data is untidy and incomplete such as missing values, noisy values. So by cleaning the data, we improve its quality to improve accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Makes Data Presentable – Sometimes, the data is in a different format than needed for which we may want to change its format and schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scaling Down the Data – The data available might be too huge in size for which we would have to reduce its size. Also, we may want to analyze specific things about specific variables for which we need to use data wrangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finding Outliers – Sometimes, the data may contain outliers or errors that may need to be removed or replaced. Also, in some cases the data might be biased which can lead to sampling error, for example, interpreting the global opinion about the most unsafe countries; the participants might be from a particular country, or the questions might be too value or biased.
