    "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence,which focuses on using statistical techniques to build intelligent computer systems in order to learn from databases available to it. Machine Learning is a way of taking data and turning it into insights. We use computer power to analyze examples from the past to build a model that can predict the result for new examples.<br>\n",
